# Autechre - SIGN/PLUS inspired theme for VSCode

An easy-on-eyes reduced colors theme for VSCode made from Autechre SIGN/PLUS album covers.
The themes are still pretty raw, so you can contact me via email://weuoimi@gmail.com or send an issue on github and suggest some changes.

The goal is to create a grayish reduced colors vs code theme, that is easy on eyes. Thanks to The Designers Republic, I have a perfect palette!
